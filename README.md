First Odin Project

Have studied basics on Git, created repo in GitHub, cloned to local, and did some basic Git commands like add, stage, commit, status, log, push. 

Have studied about HTML, DOCTYPE, tags, elements, head, body, meta, title, headers, paragraph, bold text, italic text, links, images.

Learned about the seven rules of Git commit message: 
1. Separate subject from body with a line. 
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters. 
3. Capitalize subject line. 
4. Do not end the subject line with a period. 
5. Use imperative in subject line. 
6. Wrap body to 72 characters. 
7. Use body to explain what and how vs. why.
